Description:
This project seeks to make investing in the S&P500 stocks a simpler process. The program prompts a user for a budget, risk tolerance, and a stock they want use to find either very similar stocks or very different stocks. Using this information, we build a stock portfolio using data from about five years of S&P 500 stock data.

Dependencies:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib

How to run:
1. Install Python 3.10
2. Install all dependencies using a pip install
3. Clone the repository or download the code
4. Open the deFAANG.py file and run it
5. Follow the prompts for inputs (be sure to only input exactly what is instructed)
