Description:
This project seeks to make investing in the S&P500 stocks a simpler process. The program prompts a user for a budget, risk tolerance, and a stock they want use to find either very similar stocks or very different stocks. Using this information, we build a stock portfolio using data from about five years of S&P 500 stock data.
